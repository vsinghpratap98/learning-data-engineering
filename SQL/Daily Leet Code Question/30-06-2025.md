### Problem: Find Low Fat and Recyclable Products

**Table: Products**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| product_id  | int  |
| low_fats    | enum |
| recyclable  | enum |

- `product_id` is the primary key (i.e., contains unique values).
- `low_fats` is an `ENUM('Y', 'N')` where:
  - `'Y'` means the product is low fat.
  - `'N'` means it is not.
- `recyclable` is an `ENUM('Y', 'N')` where:
  - `'Y'` means the product is recyclable.
  - `'N'` means it is not.

---

### Task

Write an SQL query to **find the `product_id`s of products that are both low fat and recyclable**.

---

### Example Output

Assuming the `Products` table contains the following data:

| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 0          | Y        | Y          |
| 1          | Y        | N          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | Y          |

**Expected Output:**

| product_id |
|------------|
| 0          |
| 3          |

---

### SQL Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    low_fats ENUM('Y', 'N'),
    recyclable ENUM('Y', 'N')
);
````

---

### Solution

```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

```
